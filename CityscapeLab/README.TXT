Introduction

The goal of this lab is for you to demonstrate that you can define classes,
	create objects, and display graphics via a Java application.


Requirements

* Create a Java graphical application (with a Viewer class, Component class) that displays a cityscape.
* Design at least three classes for elements of the cityscape (e.g., building, window, sun, moon, car, tree)
    * demonstrate good class design (encapsulation)
    * provide configurability through constructors and instance variables (size, color, etc.)
* Create multiple instances of a class with different properties and display in the cityscape.
* Document the class using JavaDoc comments as demonstrated in our code templateView in a new window.
* Peer review another student's lab and provide comments in the rubric hosted in Canvas.


Extensions

* Define additional classes for additional elements of the cityscape.
* Animate your cityscape (e.g., day and night, lights in windows, moving cars)
* Randomize your cityscape (a different cityscape every time)
* Add more awesome.


Submission

* Submit a pull request in GitHub and submit a link to the request with this assignment.
